# Endovia Wealth Central

This is a **Next.js** application. Use this guide to install dependencies, build the project, and manage it in production with **PM2**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Application

```bash
npx next build
```

### 3. Start the Application with PM2

```bash
pm2 start npm --name "maxspike-central" -- start
```

> This starts the Next.js server using PM2 under the process name `maxspike-central`.

### 4. Stop the Application

```bash
pm2 stop maxspike-central
```

### 5. Save PM2 Process List (for startup persistence)

```bash
pm2 save
```

This saves the current PM2 process list so it can be resurrected on server restart.
